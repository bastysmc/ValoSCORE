# ValoSCORE
ValoSCORE is a project developed specifically for the design and implementation of a monitoring platform for the evolution of statistics in video games.

In this case, I tried to implement such an application for a game called Valorant, a first person shooter game developed by Riot Games. For any user, the stats from this game are saved in a website called [tracker.gg](https://tracker.gg/).

The objective of this app is to store these stats into a local S.Q.L. server that has an auto-generated database if you open the app for the first time. The public available stats from website for any introduced user are collected, saved and updated into the database by using a Web Scraping service called Selenium WebDriver. 

After that, there is no need for an active Internet connection to check your stats or others (unless you want to update the data). 
As for the User Interface, as well as back-end code, I used C# with a WPF custom-made template by myself.
`Language available : Romanian - other languages will be implemented soon`
`More info about the app and details will be coming soon!`
